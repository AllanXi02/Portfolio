          <p className="home__paragraph">
            In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, AI, VR, and Blockchain are poised to revolutionize our future. By 2027, with global bandwidth coverage, the world will witness unprecedented network transmission speeds. This development will enable real-time, low-latency interactions necessary for VR applications and massive data transfers. Enhanced AI capabilities will transform monotonous and repetitive tasks into more intuitive and engaging experiences, leveraging AR and VR to create immersive interactions.

          <p className="home__paragraph">
            The integration of VR and AI promises a paradigm shift from two-dimensional interfaces to three-dimensional environments, offering unparalleled engagement and functionality. This transition will be facilitated by the enhanced network infrastructure, supporting seamless, high-speed data interactions. AR and VR will revolutionize user interactions, establishing a new standard for visual and operational interfaces.

          <p className="home__paragraph">
            Compared to 4G, 5G offers faster speeds, but its applications have not produced a revolutionary experience. In terms of immersive VR experiences and the high bandwidth, low latency, and high stability required for cloud services, 5G has not met expectations. However, these gaps can be addressed within the 6G technology framework. 6G transmission rates may be 50 times higher than 5G, with latency reduced to one-tenth of 5G. In peak rate, latency, traffic density, connection density, mobility, spectrum efficiency, and positioning capabilities, 6G far surpasses 5G.
