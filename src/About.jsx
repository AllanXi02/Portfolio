 The rose family dates back to over 30 million years ago. Though the flowers have evolved to sport natural beauty, easy hybridization between species made them a popular target for cultivation. Starting around 5,000 years ago, Chinese gardeners began to experiment with rose breeding. However, it wasnâ€™t until the 18th century that these rose breeds made their way to Europe.

      The middle east was another popping center for roses, and they were grown extensively there during the Roman empire. The flowers kept gaining popularity throughout history and even became incorporated in religious use during the Middle Ages.
